A shepherd had a faithful dog , called Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them , and had lost all A shepherd teeth . And one day when A shepherd the shepherd and his wife A shepherd his wife were standing together before the house A shepherd said , " A shepherd will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning , for a faithful dog is of no use now . " But A shepherd his wife said , " Pray let the poor faithful creature live ; A shepherd has served the shepherd and his wife well a great many years , and the shepherd and his wife ought to give A shepherd a livelihood for the rest of A shepherd days . " " But what can the shepherd and his wife do with A shepherd ? " said A shepherd , " A shepherd has not a tooth in A shepherd head , and the thieves don " t care for A shepherd at all ; to be sure A shepherd has served the thieves , but then A shepherd did it to earn A shepherd livelihood ; tomorrow shall be A shepherd last day , depend upon it . " Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them the thieves , heard all that A shepherd the shepherd and his wife A shepherd his wife said to one another , and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be A shepherd last day ; so in the evening Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them went to Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them his good friend the wolf the wolf , who lived in the wood , and told him all his sorrows , and how his master meant to kill him in the morning Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them all Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them sorrows , and how Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them his master meant to kill his master in the morning . " Make yourself easy , " said the wolf , " his good friend will give you some good advice . Your his master , you know , goes out every morning very early with his master his wife into the field ; and the shepherd and his wife take the shepherd and his wife their little child with the shepherd and his wife , and lay it down behind the hedge in the shade while the shepherd and his wife are at work . Now do you lie down close by their little child , and pretend to be watching it , and his good friend will come out of the wood and run away with it ; you must run after his good friend as fast as you can , and his good friend will let it drop ; then you may carry it back , and they will think you have saved they their little child , and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live . " a faithful dog liked this plan very well ; and accordingly so it was managed . the wolf ran with the child a little way ; A shepherd the shepherd and his wife A shepherd his wife screamed out ; but Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them soon overtook Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them , and carried the poor little thing back to Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them my master . Then A shepherd patted A shepherd on the head , and said , " Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them has saved my master the child a little way from the wolf , and therefore A shepherd shall live and be well taken care of , and have plenty to eat . Wife , go home , and give A shepherd a good dinner , and let A shepherd have his good friend old cushion to sleep on as long as A shepherd lives . " So from this time forward Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them had all that Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them could wish for . Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished the wolf joy , and said , " Now , his good friend my good fellow , you must tell no tales , but turn your head the other way when his good friend want to taste one of the old shepherd " s fine fat sheep . " " No , " said Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them ; " Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them will be true to Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them my master . " However , the wolf thought the wolf was in joke , and came one night to get a dainty morsel . But Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them had told Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them his master what the wolf meant to do ; so Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them laid wait for Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them behind the barn door , and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep , the wolf had a stout cudgel laid about the wolf back , that combed the wolf locks for the wolf finely . Then the wolf was very angry , and called Sultan " an old rogue , " an old rogue , " and swore the wolf would have the wolf revenge . So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them to come into the wood to fight the matter . Now Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them could ask to be Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat ; so nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat took his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat with nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat , and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble , his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat stuck up his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat tail straight in the air . the wolf The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground ; and when The wolf and the wild boar espied The wolf and the wild boar their enemies coming , and saw his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat " s long tail standing straight in the air , The wolf and the wild boar thought his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat was carrying a sword for Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them to fight with ; and every time his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat limped , The wolf and the wild boar thought his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat was picking up a stone to throw at The wolf and the wild boar ; so The wolf and the wild boar said The wolf and the wild boar should not like this way of fighting , and the boar lay down behind a bush , and the wolf jumped up into a tree . Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them Sultan and the cat his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat soon came up , and looked about and wondered that no one was there . The boar , however , had not quite hidden Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them , for Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them ears stuck out of the bush ; and when Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them shook one of them a little , his second but the shepherd " s old three - legged cat , seeing something move , and thinking it was a mouse , sprang upon it , and bit and scratched it , so that the boar jumped up and grunted , and ran away , roaring out , " Look up in the tree , there sits the one who is to blame . " So they looked up , and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches ; and they called the wolf a cowardly rascal , and would not suffer the wolf to come down till the wolf was heartily ashamed of the wolf , and had promised to be good friends again with Poor Sultan , who was lying close by them .
